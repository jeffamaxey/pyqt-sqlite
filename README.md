PyQt SQLite
=============

This software is written for teaching porposes. It is not a complete software to create/edit/modify SqLite. If you need such a software,
there are many that you can find through internet serach. Don't use this package in production.

With this software, I will try to explain how PyQt can be used to develop a running software. After this software has somehow mature, I will
write a tutorial.

You can write your suggestion for developing this software.

You need > python 3.4 and > PyQt5.7 to run this software.
